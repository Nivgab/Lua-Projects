# Lua-Projects

Welcome to my Lua projects page, I am v7.
This is where I store my lua code. (keep in mind all of my lua projects won't be here since some will be private)
The lua projects that I will release here will all be open sourced, just for you to use.
If you are just here for scripts, keep in mind that I don't like skids.
Skids are people who steal someone's code and claim it as their own or modify it and claim it as their own, its really painful when someone does that to you.






Here are my current Lua projects:
# Nitro Gift Generator
